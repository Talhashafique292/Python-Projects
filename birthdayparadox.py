print('''Birthday Paradox, by Al Sweigeart al@inventwithpython.com

The Birthday Paradox shows us that in a group of N people, the odds
that two of them have matching birthdays is surprisingly large.
This programe does a Monto Carlo simulation (that is, repeated random
Simulations) to explore this concept.

(Its not actually a paradox, its just a surprising result.)
